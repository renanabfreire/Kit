# Lagrangian Relaxation
---
I now need to implement Lagrangian Relaxation applied to the TSP.

- I will explore a solution using the Minimum Spanning Tree, with some modifications to serve as a relaxation for the TSP.
- I will apply Lagrangian Relaxation to compute the highest lower bounds and make it more viable to apply branch-and-bound.
