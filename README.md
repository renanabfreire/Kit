# A simple solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem

The activity proposed [here](https://kit.logq.dev/) is intended to help me practice and begin my studies in combinatorial optimization.

1. I resolved the Traveling Salesman Problem using the ILS Framework, and concepts like Local Search and Perturbation.
2. By reusing the functions, I modified the code to also solve the Minimum Latency Problem using the same instances as the TSP.
3. After that, I used the Branch and Bound method to solve the TSP optimally.
